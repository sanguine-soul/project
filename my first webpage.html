				<p><h3><address>You walked into my life and damn, you made a mark!!We had no idea about each other's existence and may be that was how it was supposed to be. I remember it was my birthday and i was in my black patiyala and a purple tshirt with a black shrug(and the nerdy hairstyle).Ofcourse i spoke to boys those days but you were an unfamiliar face in our class for me! All i knew about you was that you were Freeda's rumoured boyfriend. You were always a talented chunk solving maths, everyones common friend...No one was there in the class and you wanted to ask Aadhvika(then Akshata) some doubt.Well, she was busy and couldn't answer you!Uff! so i answered it and i guess you didn't expect that coming. I Still couldn't forget that you showed me a middle finger out of nowhere and said fuck off!</address></h3></p><br>

				<p><h3><address>To be honest, it was rough.I kinda hated you but then we slowly started talking and i started understanding how you had so many friends, why people loved you.You were genuine, smart, caring and you had that charishma which was attractive. And your smile; i dont know about others but it did melt me.I guess that year passed too soon.</address></h3></p><br>

               <p><h3><address> This was a very special stage of our friendship for me! I had actually started knowing you!When I began falling for you, I was good at ignoring the feelings at first.If Gautam and Arvind wouldn't have created a spark, then i guess i would have never confronted you! You too kept quite thinking it would harm our friendship.But, our friendship kept getting stronger by the day and so did my feelings.I was falling for myfriend(now best friend).You had become an important part of my life and i didn't want to lose you!I had to be honest with you for my own sanity.I’ve never met anybody like you and i guess i would never meet one!</address></h3></p><br>
